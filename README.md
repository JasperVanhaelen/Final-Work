## ⚙️ Core Systems

### ⚡ Energy System

  - **Needed Energy**: Total energy required to keep all buildings active.
- If **Needed Energy > Current Energy**:
  - Businesses stop producing coins.
  - Houses appear greyed out to visually reflect energy shortages.

### 📋 Mission System

- Examples of missions:
